# Gradient-descent-variants
This notebook contains three functions to implement gradient descent variants (batch, mini-batch, stochastic) by python from scratch without sklearn. Each variant is followed by many graphs to illustrate its performance depending on the learning rate and number of iterations to fit the model with data.<br>
